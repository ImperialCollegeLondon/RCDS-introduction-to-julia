    "## How can we calculate $\\pi$?\n",

    "Given a square of length $2r$, the square's area is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_{square} = (2r)^2 = 4r^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "whereas the area of a circle with radius $r$ is\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"readme-images/area_ratio.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the ratio of the area of the circle to that of the square above is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}} = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{4r^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and we can define $\\pi$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi = 4\\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests a way to calculate $\\pi$: if we have a square and the largest circle that fits inside that square, we can determine the ratio of areas of a circle and a square. We can calculate this ratio using a monte carlo simulation. We select random points inside a square, and we keep track of how often those points also fall inside the circle that fits perfectly inside that square.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a large enough sampling points, $\\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}}$ will be equal to the fraction of randomly chosen points inside the square that also fall inside the circle. Then we can figure out $\\pi$!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pseudo-code\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above, our algorithm for determining $\\pi$ looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each of $N$ iterations,\n",
    "    1. Select a random point inside a square of area $4r^2$ as Cartesian, $(x, y)$, coordinates.\n",
    "    1. Determine if the point also falls inside the circle embedded within this square of area $\\pi r^2$.\n",
    "    1. Keep track of whether or not this point fell inside the circle. At the end of $N$ iterations, you want to know $M$ -- the number of the $N$ random points that fell inside the circle!\n",
    "1. Calculate $\\pi$ as $4\\frac{M}{N}$\n",

    "\n",
    "Write a function that calculates $\\pi$ using Julia.\n",
    "\n",

    "*Hint*:\n",
    "\n",
    "This will probably be easier if you center your circle and square at the coordinate (0, 0) and use a radius of 1. For example, to choose random coordinates within your square at position (x, y), you may want to choose x and y so that they are each a value between -1 and +1. Then any point within a distance of 1 from (0, 0) will fall inside the circle!\n",
